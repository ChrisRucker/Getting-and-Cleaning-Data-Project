=================================
Create a R script called 'run_analysis.R'.

Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extract measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
Create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Download the data source UCI HAR Dataset.
Set UCI HAR Dataset as your working directory using setwd() function and include run_analysis.R.
Execute 'run_analysis.R' to generate tiny_data.txt in your working directory.

'run_analysis.R' depends on reshape2 and data.table.
